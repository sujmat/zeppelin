__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__


iOS Conf SG prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at any iOS Conf SG events (including after-parties). Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the conference.

If someone is bothering you, please tell iOS Conf SG Organizers immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain iOS Conf SG's awesomeness.
