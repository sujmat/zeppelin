  description: "Everything amazing has a beginning and a story worth knowing. This year will be our fourth year running the iOS Conf SG. It started with a failure, followed by success, a loss in the way and the journey that made me a person what I am Today - not willing to give up on anything without trying. Instead of just welcoming you all like I do everytime - let me take you through that journey this time."

  title: "The Art of Designing Code"
  speakers: [11]
  description: "There are many similarities between ‚Äúdesigning user interfaces‚Äù and ‚Äúdesigning code.‚Äù Both are a means of communication: A user interface needs to communicate the app‚Äôs functionality to the user, code needs to express what it does to other developers. As a consequence, code also needs to be well designed, and developers can learn a lot from designers in that respect. The goal of this talk is to give developers the tools in their hand to write better code that‚Äôs easy to read and understand.

  speakers: [1]
  description: "Since launch, almost all iOS apps were designed for a single screen, but with Marzipan on macOS and USB-C monitors on iPad that's finally about to change. In this talk you'll learn how to build apps that work great across multiple windows, first with a walkthrough of all the theory then a live coding demonstration so you can see exactly what the steps are."

  speakers: [5]
  description: "Auto Layout is the most powerful tool on iOS today, to support developers in creating adaptive user interfaces on iOS. The power of this great technology lies in how simple its foundations are. The engineers behind Auto Layout at Apple started to reveal more of the internals of their technology recently, to help us understand its principles better, in order to get the best performance out of our layout code.Let‚Äôs look more closely at how the Auto Layout engine solves constraints through exploring the Cassowary algorithm, that‚Äôs running under the hood, turning constraints into linear equations, and solving them. By doing the math ourselves, we‚Äôll have a better understanding of what layouts are easier, or more difficult to satisfy. What coding practices can help us achieve best Auto Layout performance."

  description: "Christian has developed numerous Augmented and Virtual Reality apps for Enterprise scenarios for example to visualize big data in 3D and make data tangible. In this talk Christian will develop during the talk an Augmented Reality game based on Apples ARKit. The scenario is based in a galaxy far, far away. During the talk he will also describe how Augmented Reality works today and what the current limitations are. He will finish the talk with an outlook of what he expects to happen in the industry in the next years and what we can expect from future Augmented Reality technologies."

New in Swift 5, Swift will include an official Result type. In this talk we‚Äôll look at why you want a Result type, how and when to use it, what map and flatMap bring you for Result, and why you might not need it in the future."

  description: "Code formatter is one of the most important tool to write a beautiful Swift code. If you are working with the team, 'code consistency' is always a problem, and your team's guideline and code review can probably ease a little. Since Xcode doesn't fully fix our problems, now it's a time to make our own automatic style-rule! In this talk, we will look into how Swift language forms a formal grammar and AST, how it can be parsed, and we will see the power of SwiftSyntax and it's structured editing that everyone can practice."

I intend to show that using Foundation API, its easy to use the filesystem to power lightweight view controllers, animated tableview updates, interprocess communication, and syncing without resorting to heavyweight solutions like Core Data and Realm."

Their addition went quite under the radar, yet they bear a lot of power when it comes to making your code more declarative, like manipulating data with a SQL-like syntax."
